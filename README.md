# Project-3-Phase-Hunter
My third project for my Treehouse tech-degree course. Features a catchphrase guessing game! 

Useage:

• A fun game where users guess letters to try and complete the phrase in 5 or less tries!

Instructions:

• Type any letter from a-z when prompted to do so!

• At the end of the game the user will be asked whether they want to continue playing or not. Enter yes or no at your will. 

Enjoy :)
